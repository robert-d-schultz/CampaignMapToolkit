# Campaign AI Map Editor — Main Interface Guide

---

## Overview

Campaign AI Map Editor (CAIME) is a painting application for creating campaign map data files used by Total War games. Think of it like Adobe Photoshop, but instead of painting colours for artistic purposes, you are painting *game data* — telling the game engine where roads are, where rivers flow, what climate each region has, and much more.

Each type of map data lives on its own **Layer**, just like layers in Photoshop. You pick a layer, pick a colour (called a **Swatch**), and paint onto the map. When you are done, the application converts your painted canvas into the binary files the game engine reads.

Supported games: **Rome 2, Attila, Thrones of Britannia, Warhammer, Warhammer 2, Warhammer 3, Three Kingdoms, Troy, Pharaoh,** and **Pharaoh Dynasties**.

```

The **Quick-Settings Bar** sits below the Menu Bar and provides fast access to the most commonly adjusted painting settings. It only appears when a project is open.

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Brush Size slider** | Drag left or right to make your brush smaller (1) or larger (10). The current size number is displayed next to the slider. |
| **BG Opacity slider** | Controls how visible the background reference image is (0 = invisible, 100 = fully visible). Only relevant when a background image is loaded. |
| **Clear background image button (✕)** | Removes the loaded background reference image from the viewport. |
| **Source dropdown** | Selects which layer is used as the source for the **Flood Fill** tool. For example, you can flood-fill the *Ground Types* layer using the shape of a *Regions* boundary. |

---

## 5. The Toolbar — Painting Tools

```
 ┌───┐
 │ M │  ← Pan
 │ Z │  ← Zoom
 │ B │  ← Brush
 │ F │  ← Flood Fill
 │ E │  ← Eraser
 │ I │  ← Background Image
 │ L │  ← Line
 │ P │  ← Color Picker
 │ ⚙ │  ← Properties
 └───┘
```

The **Toolbar** is the narrow vertical strip on the left side of the editor. It contains all of your painting tools. Click a tool icon (or press its hotkey) to activate it — only one tool can be active at a time.

| Icon | Hotkey | Tool Name | What It Does |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Pan icon | **M** | **Pan** | Click and drag to move the map around the viewport. This is the default navigation tool and does not paint anything. |
| Zoom icon | **Z** | **Zoom** | Scroll the mouse wheel (or click and drag) to zoom the map in or out. |
| Brush icon | **B** | **Brush** | Paints hexes with the currently selected Swatch colour. Click a hex or click-and-drag across multiple hexes. |
| Flood Fill icon | **F** | **Flood Fill** | Fills an entire connected area of the same colour with the selected Swatch. Works like the paint bucket in MS Paint. |
| Eraser icon | **E** | **Eraser** | Removes the painted data from hexes, returning them to blank/empty. |
| BackImg icon | **I** | **Background Image** | Loads a reference image (e.g. a hand-drawn map scan) behind the hex grid so you can trace over it. |
| Line icon | **L** | **Line** | Click to set a start point, then click again to paint a straight line of hexes between the two points. |
| ColorPicker icon | **P** | **Color Picker** | Click any hex to pick up its Swatch colour as the active painting colour. **Pro-tip:** Hold **Alt** on your keyboard to temporarily switch to the Color Picker at any time, then release **Alt** to return to your previous tool. |
| Properties icon | **⚙** | **Properties** | Opens a dialog with advanced settings for the current brush. |

> **How to know which tool is active?** The active tool's button appears highlighted/pressed in the Toolbar.

---

## 6. The Main Viewport (Map Canvas)

The large centre area of the application is the **Map Canvas** — this is where your campaign map is displayed as a grid of hexagonal tiles. Everything you paint appears here in real time.

```
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Navigating the map:**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Mouse wheel scroll** | Zoom in or out |
| **Middle mouse button drag** | Pan (scroll around) the map |
| **Select Pan tool (M) + left-click drag** | Pan the map |
| **Select Zoom tool (Z) + mouse wheel** | Zoom in or out |

**Painting on the map:**

1. Select a **Layer** from the Sidebar (see Section 7).
2. Select a **Swatch** (colour) from the Sidebar.
3. Select a **painting tool** from the Toolbar (e.g. **Brush**).
4. **Click** or **click-and-drag** on hexes in the viewport to paint them.

The status bar at the bottom always shows the current hex coordinates under your cursor (`X:` and `Y:`).

---

## 7. The Sidebar

The **Sidebar** is the 250-pixel-wide panel on the right side of the editor. It is divided into five collapsible sections. Click any section header to expand or collapse it. The diagram shows a Three Kingdoms project, which has every layer, in the built-in layer order.

### Minimap

The **Minimap** is a thumbnail view of the entire campaign map. It lets you see the big picture even when the main viewport is zoomed in close.

- The **red rectangle** on the minimap shows you exactly which part of the map is currently visible in the main viewport.
- **Click anywhere on the minimap** to instantly jump the main viewport to that area.

---

### Swatches

The **Swatches** section lets you choose *what* you paint with — the colour or data value that will be applied to hexes when you use a painting tool.

```
  ■  [Colour Preview Box]    [▼  Swatch Name Dropdown]
```

- The coloured square on the left shows a preview of the currently selected swatch.
- Click the **dropdown** on the right to open a list of all available swatches for the currently active layer.
- Select a swatch from the list to make it the active painting colour.

> **Note:** The swatches available depend entirely on which **Layer** is selected. For example, the *Ground Types* layer has swatches like "Grassland" and "Desert", while the *Climates* layer has swatches like "Temperate" and "Arid".

---

### Actions

The **Actions** section shows buttons that perform operations on the active layer's swatches. The available buttons may change depending on which layer is selected.

| Button | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **New** | Creates a new swatch entry for the active layer |
| **Rename** | Renames the currently selected swatch |
| **Remove** | Deletes the currently selected swatch |
| **Cleanup** | Removes any swatches that are not painted on any hex (cleans up unused entries) |

---

### Layer Opacity

The **Layer Opacity** section sets how see-through the **active** layer is. It shows the layer's name, a slider and the current percentage.

- Drag the slider down to let the visible layers below show through. The canvas follows the slider while you drag it. With the slider focused, the arrow keys move it 1% at a time and Page Up/Page Down 10%.
- For quick presets, right-click a row in the **Layers** list and choose **Opacity** → **100% (reset)**, **75%**, **50%** or **25%**.
- Opacity is display only. It never changes your map data or exported files, and every layer starts at 100% when a project opens.

See [Layer opacity](user-guide-layers-reference.md#layer-opacity) for how blending behaves.

---

### Layers

The **Layers** section is one of the most important parts of the application. It works just like the Layers panel in Photoshop — each layer holds one specific type of map data, and you paint each layer independently.

```
  ☑      Roads                   ⋮   ← Drag handle (⋮)
  ☑      Regions          60%    ⋮   ← Opacity below 100%
  ☒      Climates                ⋮   ← Hidden layer (unchecked)
  ☑  ●  Ground Types             ⋮   ← Active layer (highlighted)
                     [Reset order]
```

**Understanding the Layers List:**

| Element | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Checkbox (☑/☒)** | Toggles the layer's visibility on the map canvas. Uncheck to hide a layer without deleting it. |
| **Radio button (●)** | Marks the **active** layer — the one you are currently painting on. Only one layer can be active at a time. |
| **Layer name** | The name of the layer. The active layer's name appears highlighted. |
| **Percentage** | The layer's opacity. Only shown while it is below 100%. |
| **Three dots (⋮)** | The drag handle for re-arranging layers (see below). |

**How to switch layers:**

1. Find the layer you want to paint on in the **Layers** list.
2. Click the **radio button** next to its name, or anywhere else on the row except the checkbox and the **⋮** dots, to make it the active layer.
3. The **Swatches** section above will automatically update to show the swatches for that layer.
4. You can now paint on the map using your selected tool and swatch.

**How to re-arrange layers:**

Layers higher in the list are drawn on top. To change the order, drag a layer by the **⋮** dots on its right and drop it where the white line shows it will land, or right-click a row and choose **Move up**, **Move down**, **Move to top** or **Move to bottom**. The **Reset order** button under the list restores the built-in order. The order only affects what you see, and CAIME remembers it for each game in your preferences.

To see the layers below one without hiding it, lower its opacity in the [Layer Opacity](#layer-opacity) section.

**Standard layers** (available in all supported games, listed from top to bottom in their built-in order; your own order may differ if you have re-arranged them):

| Layer Name | What It Controls |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Impassable** | Areas that cannot be entered by armies |
| **Roads** | Road network paths |
| **Town Slots** | The exact hexes where settlements can be placed |
| **Town Sprawl** | The visual spread area around settlement hexes |
| **Bridges** | Bridge crossing locations |
| **Rivers** | River paths across the map |
| **Beaches** | Coastal/beach hex locations |
| **Regions** | Which political region each hex belongs to |
| **Attritions** | Areas that cause attrition (damage to armies over time) |
| **Climates** | Climate zones across the map |
| **Ground Types** | The terrain type of each hex (grass, desert, snow, etc.) |

**Game-specific layers** (only appear when your project is set to the relevant game):

| Layer Name | Games |
|------------|-------|
| **Trade Routes** | Rome 2, Attila, Thrones of Britannia, Three Kingdoms |
| **Region Borders** | Attila and later |
| **Restrictions** | Attila and later |
| **Areas of Interest** | Warhammer 3, Three Kingdoms |

In the built-in order, **Trade Routes** sits just below **Impassable**, and **Restrictions**, **Region Borders** and **Areas of Interest** sit between **Beaches** and **Regions**, in that order.

## 8. The Status Bar

```
  [Last log message text...]           X: 42   Y: 17   60 FPS   v1.0.0
```

The **Status Bar** is the thin ribbon running along the very bottom of the application window. It gives you at-a-glance information about the current state of the editor.

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Last log message** | The most recent information, warning, or error message from the application. Click it to open the full **Logger** window and see the complete message history. |
| **X: [number]** | The horizontal column coordinate of the hex currently under your mouse cursor. |
| **Y: [number]** | The vertical row coordinate of the hex currently under your mouse cursor. |
| **[number] FPS** | The current rendering frame rate. Lower numbers can indicate the map is very large or your machine is under heavy load. |
| **v[version]** | The current version of the application. |

> **Tip:** If something unexpected happens, the **Last log message** in the status bar is the first place to look. Click on it to open the full Logger and read the complete details.

## 10. Pro-Tips & Troubleshooting

- **If you accidentally paint over an area**, immediately press **Ctrl+Z** to undo. CAIME supports multiple undo steps, so you can press **Ctrl+Z** several times in a row to step back through your recent painting history.

- **If the "Save" option is greyed out** or doesn't seem to respond, check that you have an open project — use **File > Open** (Ctrl+O) to open a `.hex` file first. Similarly, if a message appears saying *"Missing Assembly Kit path"*, go to **Settings > Preferences** (Ctrl+P) and set the correct path to your game's Assembly Kit installation folder.

- **If the map canvas feels slow or laggy**, check the **FPS counter** in the Status Bar. Try hiding some layers (uncheck their visibility checkbox in the Layers panel) to reduce the number of things being drawn at once. You can re-enable them at any time — hiding a layer does not delete any painted data.

- **If a Process or Validation step fails**, click the **Last log message** text in the Status Bar (or press **Ctrl+L**) to open the Logger window. The detailed error messages listed there will tell you exactly which hexes or layers have issues that need to be fixed before exporting.

- **If you want to trace over a real map image**, use the **Background Image tool (I)** to load a reference picture. Then use the **BG Opacity slider** in the Quick-Settings Bar to make it semi-transparent so you can see your painted hexes on top of it. When you no longer need the reference image, click the **Clear background image (✕)** button to remove it without affecting any of your painted layers.

- **If your Flood Fill is not spreading the way you expect**, check the **Source** dropdown in the Quick-Settings Bar. This controls which layer defines the "boundary" for the flood fill. Setting it to the same layer you are painting will fill based on that layer's existing colours; setting it to a different layer (e.g. *Regions*) will use that layer's shape as the fill boundary instead.
